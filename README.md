## Challenges faced:
- Learning 3D mesh manipulation was a whole new experience for me. It was a bit unintuitive at first, but over time I got the hang of it.

- Animation was my weakest area; I donâ€™t like animating things, so instead, I tried to create procedural animations that are done through code. For example, the recoil is procedural and can be modified as desired.

- Finding the correct spawn logic for the enemy was tricky as I had to find the right balance of gameplay difficulty and player enjoyment.
